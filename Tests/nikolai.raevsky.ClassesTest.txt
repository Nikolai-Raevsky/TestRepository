_______ A struct in C++ can contain methods. 
_______ A struct can only have public members. 
_______ A default constructor can be defined either with default arguments for all arguments or 
with no arguments at all (i.e. void). 
_______ Conversion constructors can be used only to convert to the class' type, not to another 
type.   
_______ A copy constructor must have two explicit parameters: a reference to the class that is 
being copied from and a reference to the class that is being copied to. 
_______ An initialization list may only be used with constructors.
